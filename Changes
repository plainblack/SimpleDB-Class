 - Rethought the whole subclassing approach. Now subclassing the result rather than the domain, and everything is much cooler, and is much closer to DBIx::Class. Check out the docs for API changes.
 - While rewriting discovered that all relationship and attribute methods were global (all classes in the schema got them), which is a huge bug. This problemhas been eliminated in this version as well.
 - Added Sub::Name to the prereqs.
